# Let's delve deeper into your pipeline's Operator, Mapper and Aggregator stages.
# An operator is a fundamental unit of processing in a data pipeline. It performs a specific task on the data, transforming it from one state to another. In your pipeline, you've already mentioned Mapper and Aggregator as operators.
# Mapper Stage
# Purpose: Typically, the Mapper stage is responsible for transforming each individual data item into a new format or extracting relevant information.
# Common Tasks:
# Data Enrichment: Adding additional context or details to each data item.
# Data Cleaning: Correcting errors, inconsistencies, or missing values.
# Data Normalization: Standardizing data formats or values.
# Feature Engineering: Creating new features from existing ones to improve model performance.
# Example: If your data is in a raw format, the Mapper might parse it into a structured format, extract specific fields, and apply necessary transformations.
# 
# Aggregator Stage
# Purpose: The Aggregator stage combines multiple data items into a single aggregated value or summary.
# Common Tasks:
# Grouping: Grouping data based on specific criteria (e.g., time, category, user).
# Aggregation Functions: Applying functions like SUM, COUNT, AVERAGE, MIN, MAX to calculate aggregated values.
# Joining: Combining data from multiple sources based on common keys.
# Example: If you have sales data for different products, the Aggregator might calculate the total sales for each product or the average sales per month.
# 
# Please provide more details about your specific use case so I can offer more tailored advice. For instance:
# 
# Data Source: Where is the data coming from (e.g., a database, file, API)?
# Data Format: What is the structure or format of the data?
# Mapper Tasks: What specific transformations or calculations does the Mapper need to perform?
# Aggregator Tasks: What kind of aggregations or groupings do you want to apply?
# Output: What is the desired output of the pipeline (e.g., a summary table, a visualization)?
# With this information, I can help you refine the Mapper and Aggregator stages and ensure they effectively meet your pipeline's objectives.
